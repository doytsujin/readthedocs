Google Genomics Cookbook
========================

Welcome to the Google Genomics Cookbook on Read the Docs. 

  +--------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | The Google Genomics Cookbook on Read the Docs is not actively      |
  | maintained. For the most up to date documentation, view the        |
  | official Google Genomics documentation at                          |
  | `cloud.google.com/genomics`_. There you will find information such |
  | as `What is Google Genomics`_, `Google Genomics fundamentals`_,    |
  | and details of the `Google Genomics API`_.                         |
  |                                                                    |
  | Also note that much of the Genomics v1 API surface has been        |
  | superseded by Variant Transforms and htsget. See the `deprecation  |
  | notice <https://cloud.google.com/genomics/deprecation>`_ for more  |
  | information.                                                       |
